    The class has three constructor which are:
        - having no parameter: values of both length and breadth are assigned zero.
        - having two numbers as parameters: the two numbers are assigned as length and breadth respectively.
        - having one number  as parameter: both length and breadth are assigned that number.
    Now crate objects of "Rectangle" class having none, one and two parameters and print their areas using member function area.

9. WAP to add and subtract 2 distances d1 and d2 (feet, inch) using operator overloading + and - using friend function.
10. WAP to overload >, <, == operator to compare two distances(feet, inch) using the concept of operator overloading using member function.
11. WAP to overload >, <, == operator to compare two distances(feet, inch) using the concept of operator overloading using friend function.

6. A bookshop in Kathmandu valley sells books and DVD. Two classes Book and DVD are inherited from the astract base class Media. The Media class has common data members such as title and publication. The class Book has data members such as number_of_pages and that of DVD has data member such as duration. Each class members has member functions such as read data() and showdata(). WAP for modeling the class hierarchy for book shop and process objects of these classes using pointers to the base class.
7. Design a class that represents paper. Create class book, nespaper, copy derived from class paper. Add necessary member function to make your program meaningful and also show constructor and virtual destructor. Create object Dynamically using pointer to the base class.

    - getInput()
    - display()
    - add_record
    - show_record
    - search_record_by_isbn_number & modify also.
